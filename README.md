# Module_15_Challenge

Goal: To build a robo-advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.   

To accomplish this we will make use of AWS services to create a bot that can return recommendations based on user-given inputs.

## Technologies

This module makes use of the following services, available on AWS:  
Amazon Lex  
Amazon Lambda   

These services, and others, can be found at: https://aws.amazon.com/

## Installation Guide

As the aforementioned services are offered by AWS, no installation will be required to your local machine. However, if you do not already have an account, you will need to create one. For the purposes of this module it is recommended to use the free-tier. Ultimately, the choice is up to the user.
